The employers can register and post the internships which will include all the necessary details like the domain, the project, the location, stipend,etc. 

The interns can register and search for internships according to their interests and preffered domains and other details.

When an intern finds an internship which he/she likes they can apply for it. The employer will be able to see who has applied for it along with the details of the intern who applied for it.

Based on the profile the employer can then decide whether he wants to contact them or not and further communication can be done using the details provided.
